<h2>## Difference
</h2>You may be interested in how universal-ctags is different from
exuberant-ctags. The critical and attractive changes are explained
in docs/*.rst. The preformatted version is available on line,
http://docs.ctags.io/.The most significant one is that Universal-ctags doesn't load
`~/.ctags` and `./.ctags` at starting up time. Instead, it loads
`~/.ctags.d/*.ctags` and `./.ctags.d/*.ctags`. See the above web
site and man pages
(man/ctags.1.rst.in and man/ctags-incompatibilities.7.in in the
source tree).Pull-requests are welcome!</body>
